chmod a+x * 
in directory,
to work with linux, no COM, just ttyACMx
and the dan stm32duino boards definition "http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json"

to work change:
NEW|OLD values every time executing in Mtu.changes.sh script, till I modify for ask valueshttp://http//dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json

If working with another repo boards, can change destination of upload-reset and dfu-util places, for Mtu.changes.sh.
When choosing values, recommend first ms of Mtu.detects.sh output.
Workingon patch when arduino wont detect dfu device error.


Recommended install all lastests boards libraries, m0, m3, and stm32... Choosing older boards defs dive into other errors.

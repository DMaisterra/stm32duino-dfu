chmod a+x * 
in directory,
to work with linux, no COM 
and the darius stm32duino boards definition
gonna write repo link,
change:
NEW|OLD values every time executing Mtu.changes.sh script, till I modify for ask values
If working with another repo boards, can change destination of upload-reset and dfu-util places, for Mtu.changes.sh.
When choosing values, recommend first ms of Mtu.detects.sh output.
Workingon patch when arduino wont detect dfu device error.
Recommended install all lastests boards libraries, m0, m3, and stm32... Choosing older boards derive into other errors.
